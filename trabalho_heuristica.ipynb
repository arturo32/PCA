    "### Descrição do problema\n",
    " Problema do Caixeiro Viajante (TSP) com aluguel de carros é uma extensão do clássico Problema do Caixeiro Viajante, que envolve encontrar a rota mais curta que visita um conjunto de cidades exatamente uma vez e retorna à cidade de origem. No TSP com aluguel de carros, além de visitar as cidades, o caixeiro também pode alugar carros nas cidades para viajar entre elas. O objetivo é minimizar a distância total percorrida, incluindo o aluguel de carros.\n",
    "\n",
    "Análise de Complexidade:\n",
    "O TSP com aluguel de carros é um problema NP-difícil. A complexidade computacional do TSP comum já é alta, sendo NP-completo, e a adição do aluguel de carros aumenta a complexidade do problema. A complexidade exata do TSP com aluguel de carros depende de vários fatores, incluindo o número de cidades, o número de carros disponíveis e as restrições de aluguel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Exact algorithms can find the optimal solution but are only feasible for small problem instances. Examples of exact algorithms include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Brute-force search: This involves trying all possible permutations of paths and selecting the shortest one. However, this method quickly becomes impractical even for small instances of the problem due to its factorial time complexity.\n",
    "- Dynamic programming: The Held-Karp algorithm is an example of a dynamic programming approach to solve the TSP. It has a running time of O(n^2 * 2^n).\n",
    "- Quantum exact algorithm: More recently, Ambainis et al. proposed a quantum exact algorithm for the TSP that has a running time of O(1.728^n). This algorithm is currently the best-known algorithm for solving the TSP exactly, but it is not yet practical for solving large instances of the problem.\n",
    "- Branch-and-bound and branch-and-cut algorithms: These algorithms can handle TSPs with 40-60 cities and larger instances respectively. The Concorde TSP Solver, a branch-and-cut algorithm, can solve a TSP with almost 86,000 cities.\n",

    "This code implements the Simulated Annealing algorithm. Simulated Annealing is a metaheuristic algorithm used to solve optimization problems. It is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, where a material is heated and then slowly cooled to reduce defects and improve its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `simulated_annealing` function takes several parameters: `num_iterations`, `initial_temperature`, `cooling_rate`, `route`, `car_assignments`, and `cars`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `num_iterations` specifies the number of iterations the algorithm will run for.\n",
    "- `initial_temperature` is the initial temperature of the system. It controls the probability of accepting worse solutions.\n",
    "- `cooling_rate` determines how quickly the temperature decreases over time.\n",
    "- `route` is a list representing the current route.\n",
    "- `car_assignments` is a list representing the current assignments of cars to customers.\n",
    "- `cars` is a list of available cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function initializes the current cost by calling the `calculate_total_distance` function, passing in the current `route`, `car_assignments`, and `cars`. It also initializes the `best_route`, `best_car_assignments`, and `best_cost` variables with the current values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm then enters a loop that runs for `num_iterations` iterations. In each iteration, it calculates the current temperature based on the initial temperature and the cooling rate. It then generates a random neighbor solution by calling the `generate_random_neighbor` function, passing in the current `route` and `car_assignments`. The `generate_random_neighbor` function returns a new route and car assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm calculates the cost of the neighbor solution by calling the `calculate_total_distance` function with the neighbor route, neighbor car assignments, and cars. It then checks if the neighbor solution should be accepted as the new current solution. This is determined by the `accept_solution` function, which compares the current cost and neighbor cost with the temperature. If the neighbor solution is accepted, the current route, car assignments, and cost are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm also checks if the current cost is better than the best cost found so far. If it is, the best route, car assignments, and cost are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the loop finishes, the function returns the best route, car assignments, and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the code implements the Simulated Annealing algorithm to find the best route and car assignments for a given problem. It iteratively explores neighbor solutions and accepts worse solutions with a certain probability based on the temperature. The algorithm gradually decreases the temperature over time, allowing it to escape local optima and potentially find better solutions."

The `random.choices` function is used to select two parents from the population based on the calculated probabilities. Finally, it returns the selected parents as a list.\n",

    "The `crossover` function performs crossover between two parents. It takes two parameters: `parent1` and `parent2`. It generates a random crossover point between 1 and the length of `parent1` - 1. Then, it calls the `crossover_route` function to perform crossover on the first list of each parent. The resulting lists are stored in `result1` and `result2`. The second list of each parent is also crossed over at the same crossover point. Finally, it returns two children as a list of two individuals.\n",

It iterates over the second list of the individual (representing the assignment of cars to cities) starting from index 1. For each element, it checks if a random number between 0 and 1 is less than the mutation rate. If it is, it assigns a random integer between 0 and `num_cars - 1` to the element. Finally, it returns the mutated individual.\n",

    "This code is an algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with the addition of cars. The goal is to find the shortest route that visits all locations and returns to the starting location, while also assigning each location to a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code begins by importing the necessary modules: `itertools` for generating permutations and combinations, and `time` for measuring the execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, there is a function called `calculate_total_distance` that takes in the current route, car assignments, cars, and the best distance found so far. This function calculates the total distance traveled for a given route and car assignments. It iterates over each location in the route and checks if the current car assignment is different from the next location's car assignment. If they are different, it adds the distance from the current location to the next location and the return rate from the next location to the current location. If they are the same, it only adds the distance between the current and next locations. After each iteration, it checks if the current total distance is greater than the best distance found so far. If it is, it immediately returns the current total distance. Finally, it updates the current location to be the next location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main function is called `branch_and_bound_tsp_with_cars` and takes in an instance of the problem and a list of cars. It initializes some variables: `num_cars` to store the number of cars, `num_locations` to store the number of locations, `best_route` to store the best route found so far, and `best_distance` to store the best distance found so far (initialized as infinity).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then enters a nested loop using `itertools.permutations` and `itertools.product` to generate all possible routes and car assignments. It ensures that the route starts and ends at location 0 by adding it to the beginning and end of the route. For each combination of route and car assignments, it calls the `calculate_total_distance` function to calculate the total distance traveled. If the calculated distance is less than the best distance found so far, it updates the best distance, best route, and best car assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the nested loop, the function returns the best route, best distance, and best car assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code then measures the execution time by recording the start time using `time.time()`. It calls the `branch_and_bound_tsp_with_cars` function with the given instance and cars, and stores the returned values in `best_route`, `best_distance`, and `best_car_assignments`. It records the end time and calculates the execution time by subtracting the start time from the end time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it prints the execution time, best route, best distance, and best car assignments."
